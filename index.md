# Welcome to upgradvisor website!

## What is upgradvisor?

Upgradvisor, a fusion of "upgrade" and "advisor", is a research project from Columbia University's RCS lab doing extactly that.
Our goal is to provide meaningful information for developers on how to upgrade their software dependencies.
Our work emploies static and dynamic analysis to study the change made to the dependency code and deduce the effects on the dependent code.

## Example

COMING SOON.

## Roadmap

We are hard at work developing a bot that will allow every open-source project on github to use our system!
